        <h2><a id="header-2" class="anchor" href="#header-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Beto O'Rourke</h2>
        <p>Two weaknesses that I've noticed within many candidates from the Democratic Party are inability to manage the narriative, and lack of a killer instinct. Politicians like Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton emobdy these weaknesses in my opnion, staying inside of their east coast liberal bubble. </p>
        <p>But Beto O'Rourke is a breath of fresh air. He's shown that he is willing to put in the effort required of a red meat, boots-on-the-ground campaign. He reaches out to voters in middle America instead of ignoring them. </p>
        <p>Most importantly, he has the right kind of communication skills for the social media era. When everyone has a camera in their pocket, and political discourse has moved to Twitter or Facebook, Beto O'Rourke is ready with quips and soundbites that are easily shared on social media. </p>
        <p>Cerebral, policy-based communication like from Hillary Clinton is no longer enough to win elections. Beto O'Rourke is the new face of the Democratic Party, and even if he loses on Tuesday, I think he's got a bright future ahead of him.</p><br>
        <h2>
        <a id="header-2" class="anchor" href="#header-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Marc Benioff</h2>
        <p>Marc Benioff founded Salesforce in 1999. Large businesses have to keep track of their salespeople, their customers, and the interaction between them (sales leads, commissions, number of sales, etc). Salesforce creates software that allows this to not only be automated, but be managed entirely through a web browser via the internet. This idea has made Salesforce a $100 billion company, and Marc Benioff $7 billion richer.</p>
        <p>But that's not the point. Marc's commitment to philanthropy is admirable, especially compared to someone like Steve Jobs who didn't donate any of his wealth. He came up with the 1-1-1 pledge, which means donating 1% of the company's product (could be goods or services), 1% of the company's equity, and 1% of company employee hours to worthy causes. 700 companies have "pledged 1%", as the saying goes, amassing over $500 million in philanthropic donations. So whenever someone says that wealthy CEOs are all cruel and greedy, I tell them about Marc Benioff.</p>
